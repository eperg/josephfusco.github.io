Once in a while someone will ask about the specifics of software/hardware/services I use to develop with.

This page serves as a living document of those items.

## Editor + Terminal

+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my main editor right now. I am also a fan of Atom & Sublime Text 3.
+ My current theme for VSCode is [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) with [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/).
+ [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) V3 is my terminal, however anything project specific I find myself using the built in terminal in VSCode.

## Education Resources

+ I utilize [Treehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/josephfusco) a lot for continuing education.

## Desktop Apps

+ For web design I use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).
+ Password Manager is [1Password](https://1password.com/) and highly recommend it to anyone. LastPass is also a great alternative.
+ Git client is [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/).
+ [Unclutter](https://unclutterapp.com/) is a really neat one I get a lot of use out of. Any quick notes I have I put there and sync with Dropbox.

## Desk Setup

+ Right now I run dual 24" moniters from Acer.
+ My development computer is a 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5 - 13" MacBook Pro (Early 2015) with 16GB Memory. This sits clamshelled on the side of my desk in a vertical [HengeDock](https://hengedocks.com/).

## Hosting / Domains

+ Hosting is primarily done with [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/c6fc6c159b4a). I use [ServerPilot](https://serverpilot.io/a/719ef210192e) to manage them.
+ I really enjoy using [Namecheap](https://affiliate.namecheap.com/?affId=120269) and can't recommend them enough, however, I still have a handful over at GoDaddy.
