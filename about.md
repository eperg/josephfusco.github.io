My name is Joseph Fusco, and I am a professional web developer who currently resides in Rochester, NY. Although I went to school for computer science, I am almost entirely self taught in web development.

I currently work remotely as a Front End Developer for [Incsub](http://incsub.com), the company behind both [WMPU DEV](http://premium.wpmudev.org) and [Edublogs](http://edublogs.org).
