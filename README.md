A simple portfolio theme powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

# Development

To start the server run `npm run dev`.

JS and Sass is managed with Gulp. I find it a lot faster to compile using gulp rather than relying on jekyll to build.

Run `npm install` to download dependecies and then run `gulp` to build and watch for changes.
