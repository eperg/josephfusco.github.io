Hello, my name is Joe. I am a front-end web developer born in [Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York) but now living in [Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York) with my wife, our daughter, and 2 cheeky cats. Currently building cool things with [WordPress](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joefusco) at [Incsub](http://incsub.com). I love anything nautical, hate spiders, and play the saxophone. I occasionally [write](/archive) and can often be found tinkering on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/fusco). I am extremely passionate about learning. Mashable even wrote an [article](http://mashable.com/2015/01/11/teach-yourself-programming/) about it!

Need web help? [Get in touch](mailto:hello@josephfus.co)!
