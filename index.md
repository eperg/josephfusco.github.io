Hello, my name is Joe. I am a front-end web developer born and raised in Buffalo, currently building cool things with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) at [Incsub](http://incsub.com). I love anything nautical, hate spiders, and play the saxophone. I occasionally [write](/archive).

I am passionate about learning. Mashable even wrote an [article](http://mashable.com/2015/01/11/teach-yourself-programming/) about it!

Need web help? [Get in touch](mailto:hello@josephfus.co)!
